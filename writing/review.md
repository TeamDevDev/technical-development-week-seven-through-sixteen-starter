# Assessment of Technical Development

## Assessment Overview

Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

Please note that you are invited to provide responses to all of these questions
as a part of your **Technical Development** grade in this course. It is
important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory answers to all of
these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment for one or more
parts of the assessment of your work in the technical development category.

TODO: You should delete all of the prompts in this file so as to ensure that the
final document is a comprehensive report about your technical development.

### Technical Development Reflection

TODO: Provide a brief one paragraph response to these questions.

#### What is fuzzing? How can it support the development of high-quality software?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

#### What is debugging? How can it support the development of high-quality software?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

#### What is testing? How can it support the development of high-quality software?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

#### What is one insight from either the FB or DB books that you have applied to your practice of software engineering? What happened when you applied this insight?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

#### What is one practice from either the FB or DB books that enabled you to become a more joy-filled software engineer?

TODO: Write a brief one paragraph response to this question.

### Lessons Learned in Technical Development

Write one sentence to summarize what you have learned about each skill in the
area of **technical development for software engineering**. Each sentence that
you write should be accompanied by at least one reference that supports your
summarization. While you are encouraged to cite content from the "Fuzzing Book"
and/or the "Debugging Book", it is acceptable for you to cite any source
available online. Please make sure that every reference that you provide is to
a web site link that the instructor can reference. Ultimately, you can think of
the sentence that you write as advice that you would give to a student at the
start of the next edition of the Software Engineering course.

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the prompts in the following sections.

#### Mutation Testing

TODO: Provide at least one reference to support your assertion.
TODO: Your reference should be a URL in the "Fuzzing Book"
      or a reference to a reputable web site that you found online.

#### Mutation-Based Fuzzing

TODO: Write one sentence about this skill.
TODO: Provide at least one reference to support your assertion.
